BACKEND=>

Before starting the project I used the following command to install packages related to this project

- npm init --yes
- npm i cors dotenv express mongoose validator
	cores -is used to connect the backend to the frontend
	dotemv- it is used for secret variable
	express- is used as a backend framework
	mongoose - is used as a database
	validator - is used for email and phone number validation.
	

start project
First, I created a folder config in that folder I created config.env file
that file I kept a secret variable. I kept that variable secret even at the time of deployment.

* In package.jason we need to give type=module because we want to work with nodejs
by default this file type is coomon json. so we need to change it.

	*  (express.json)To convert string to object we use express.json
what is the super keyword & and what use of the super keyword in the constructor?
=> 

At the time of revision please copy the code from controller/reservation and paste on chatgpt and get full details about this function which we used for better understanding.
especially do
 if(error.name === "Validation"){
            const validationErrors = Object.values(error.errors).map(
                (err)=> err.message
            );this code at the time of interview,


FRONTEND=>

I start frontend using some regular command i.e

	-like entering npm create vite@latest project
	- then I select react
	- then i select javascript+SWC
	-After that, I change the directory using the cd path
	- then in that path, I create node modules using the npm install

	- After that, I install  more packages using the following command
npm install react-router-dom axios react-icons react-scroll

After this, I install one more dependency not package for attractive alert messages:-   npm install react-hot-toast

At last after creating demo files and intalling all packages and dependencies i run command to check whether my app is working or not i used npm run dev

** For animated effect we install react scroll package at initaial stage.
